__ABSTRACT__
A novel strain of feline papilloma virus type 2 was assembled from metagenomic sequencing data collected from the human skin virome of a study participant who owned a house cat. This novel circular papilloma virus isolate P20 is 8069 bp in length and displays genome organization typical of other feline papilloma viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of all six open reading frames from other feline papilloma viruses suggests this isolate is most closely related to feline papilloma virus type 2, although this isolate only exhibits approximately 75% sequence synteny to other viruses of this type.
