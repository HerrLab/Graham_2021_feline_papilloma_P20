__ABSTRACT__
A novel feline papillomavirus isolate was assembled from metagenomic sequencing data collected from the human skin of a house cat owner. This circular papillomavirus isolate P20 is 8069 bp in length, has a G/C content of 54.38%, and displays genome organization typical of feline papillomaviruses with six annotated protein coding regions, but only exhibits approximately 75% sequence synteny to other feline papillomavirus genomes.
